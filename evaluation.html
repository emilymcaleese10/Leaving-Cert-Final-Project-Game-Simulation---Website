    <b><center>How my artefact meets my project objectives</center></b>
    <p>Overall, my final project achieves all project requirements and objectives. My artefact returns the correct game state (win etc.) each time and displays the score correctly using usernames. The move freqency, win, lose and draw data is collected after each game and the results are displayed on graphs. My artefact has a clear user interface that is navigable, all inputs are validated and graphs are labelled and clear. However, some features the in initial design were not added due to redundancy or time constraints. For example, I didn’t get a chance to add a starting player input for single and multiplayer game modes. Some features that are in the final project were not included in the intial design also such as move per game frequency and username inputs. I think my artefact meets the needs of my end-user, game developers, as it successfully displays game probabilities. My results can be used to adjust game difficulties. As I made this artefact, I considered the importance of user privacy and as a result no user data is collected or stored.

    <b><center>Verifying Results with Theoretical Probabilities</center></b>
    <p>From researching theoretical probabilities of tictactoe, I was able to verify my models results. Comparing them, I can confidently say that my model functions as it should as my model's results are within a percentage error of 1%.</p>

    <b><center>Reiterations of the Design Process</center></b>
    <p>In future iterations of the design cycle, I would implement the minimax algorithm that I referenced in the research section. I would create this AI and play it against the random computer to a different set of data to test different hypotheses eg. What is the probability of a random computer winning if it goes first playing against a smart computer. I think this AI would represent tictactoe gameplay better, as human players don’t play randomly but strategically like minimax. </p>
